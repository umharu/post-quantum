## Deployment  

This project is live at:  
**https://v0-code-refactor-and-test.vercel.app/**  

We use Base’s smart contract as an example:  
**[EIP7702Proxy.sol](https://github.com/base/eip-7702-proxy/blob/main/src/EIP7702Proxy.sol)**

## Overview  

Transform your legacy Solidity, Python, or Rust code into quantum-resistant implementations with the help of AI.  

This app refactors blockchain code and other programming languages, replacing classical cryptography with post-quantum secure algorithms, while also generating automated tests to validate the refactored code.  

---

## Features  

- **Intelligent Analysis**  
  Identifies cryptographic vulnerabilities and optimization opportunities using AI.  

- **Secure Refactoring**  
  Automatically replaces vulnerable algorithms with quantum-secure alternatives.  

- **Automated Testing**  
  Generates test suites that include coverage and security validation.  
  - Solidity contracts → Foundry test files (`.t.sol`).  
  - Python code → `pytest` unit tests.  
  - Rust code → `cargo test` suites.  

- **Multi-language Compatibility**  
  Works with Solidity, Python, and Rust for a modern and secure migration.  

---

## How to Use  

1. Enter or paste your code (Solidity, Python, or Rust).  
2. Run the automatic analysis and refactor process.  
3. Review and apply the suggested changes.  
4. Execute the generated tests for validation.  

---

## Benefits  

- Save time and effort compared to manual migration.  
- Immediate improvement in security against quantum threats.  
- Confidence through automatically generated tests.  

---

## Additional Tips  

1. **Explain the purpose**: Be clear about the quantum security objective and the benefits of automation.  
2. **Show use cases**: For example:  
   - *“Refactor an RSA implementation into Kyber”*  
   - *“Convert Python code using AES into a quantum-secure XChaCha20-Poly1305 implementation”*  
3. **Provide practical instructions**: Include commands, screenshots, APIs (if available), or details on how to integrate into your CI/CD pipeline.  
4. **Acknowledgments and license**: Don’t forget to mention dependencies, licenses, and credits, if applicable.

## How It Works  

- The app takes code as input through a chatbot interface.  
- It analyzes and refactors the code using AI, replacing classical cryptography with post-quantum secure approaches.  
- It outputs:  
  - Refactored code  
  - A diff-style list of changes  
  - A summary explanation  
  - A test suite in the appropriate framework
